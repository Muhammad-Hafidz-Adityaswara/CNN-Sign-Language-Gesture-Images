# **CNN : Sign Language Gesture Images**
**Project Description:**  

This project aims to develop a computer vision system that can recognize sign language through motion image analysis. Through training with large datasets and using deep learning techniques such as CNN, the system will learn to recognize hand and finger movement patterns that represent meaning in sign language. The goal is to create an intuitive user interface, allowing people with hearing disabilities to communicate more easily with the outside world. Thus, this project is expected to increase technology accessibility for them and make a positive contribution in the field of computer vision and machine learning.
